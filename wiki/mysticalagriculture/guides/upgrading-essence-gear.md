## Upgrading Essence Gear
Tools and armor can be upgraded with **augments**! Some augments include Wither Resistance, Absorption, Speed, Jump Boost etc.

## The Tinkering Table
The Tinkering Table is used to add/remove augments to your essence gear. The types of tool/armor that an augment can be applied to are listed in the tooltip of the augment.

### Applicable Tiers
Each augment has a tier. This tier is the **minimum** tier of gear that the augment can be applied to. You can apply lower tier augments to higher tier gear.

### Augment Slots
Each piece of gear can only have a certain amount of augment slots. As of this moment, there are currently **no items with more than one augment slot**.
